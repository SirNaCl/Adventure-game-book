            You hear a muffled sound behind you, you try to turn around to face the intruder but your feet is stuck in
            some goey fluid. In the midst of your struggle you hear a smug voice behind you.
            "Hah! Did you think that I wouldn't find you, you little chicken-dragon? You have finally been bamboozled
            by the mighty Linkster. Prepare to die!"
