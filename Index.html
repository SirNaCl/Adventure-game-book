            You wake up in an old abandoned house. But because you are blind you
            are not aware of this. Following your habits you make your way down
            to the kitchen where you are greeted with the familiar smell of
            bacon and coffee.

              You cluelessly walk up to the table, sit down and begin eating.

              You realise that you live alone and that you are a vegetarian
              so you yell out, "Who's there?"
