            Feeling happy with your breakfast you decide to take a walk in the nearby forrest. However, when you try
            to get up from your chair you realise that you can't move your legs. You shriek out in terror and try to
            find a way to get up from your chair. In the midst of your struggle you hear a smug voice behind you.
            "Hah! Did you think that I wouldn't find you, you little chicken-dragon? You have finally been bamboozled
            by the mighty Linkster. Prepare to die!"
